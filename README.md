## Projects Included

###  MergeSort.java
Implements the **Merge Sort algorithm**, which uses the divide-and-conquer technique to sort arrays efficiently.  
**Concepts:** Recursion, Array manipulation, Algorithm optimization.

### Product.java / ProductManager.java / ProductCategory.java
Implements a simple **Product Management System** demonstrating object-oriented principles.  
**Concepts:** Classes, Objects, Constructors, Encapsulation, and File Handling.

###  ProductLinkedList.java / ProductNode.java
Custom implementation of a **Linked List** data structure for managing product objects.  
**Concepts:** Data structures, Pointers (references), and Iteration.
